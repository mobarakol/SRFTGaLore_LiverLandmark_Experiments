# SRFTGaLore_LiverLandmark_Experiments

Model Versions:
v\_8: Cross Attention and skip DPE and Geometric augmentation and remove interpolation

v\_9: Cross Attention, SAM-SAM and skip DPE and Geometric augmentation

v\_10: Cross Attention, SAM-SAM with LoRA based on D2GP\_v9

v\_11: using Cross Attention, SAM encoder without LoRA for depth, and SAM with LoRA for image

v\_12: original CA (v\_1) with SAM+LORA

v\_13: Replace the depth using DA2 encoder based on v\_10

v\_14: Replace the depth using DA2 encoder based on v\_10, swap CA
